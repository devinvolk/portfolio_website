                <p>Born in Corvallis, Oregon in 1994, Devin begain his love of sports and the outdoors early. He first started skiing when he was 2 years old. While growing up, team sports were his primary focus. He earned 10 high school varisty
                letters: 4 in alpine skiing, 3 in soccer, 2 in track and field, and 1 in cross country. Upon graduating high school, Devin wanted to try something new and stumbled upon a video of the Ironman World Championships in Kona, Hawaii. Intrigued by 
                the demanding nature of the event and on a couple weeks of 'training', he signed up for his first triathlon one week before attending Cal Poly, SLO. After struggling to finish the first two legs of the race, the swim and bike, he got on to the run
                and set the run course record. Sensing the potential for improvement, at Cal Poly, Devin joined the triathlon team and progessed from someone who could barely swim and bike to one of the teams top athletes at the USAT Collegiate Triathlon National 
                Championships. Hooked on the feeling of constant developement, Devin began training more and more while also reading as much as he could about sports performance and training philosophies. He graduated Cal Poly in 2018 with a BS in  Biological 
                Sciences concentrating in Anatomy and Physiology and came 3rd overall combined at the USAT Collegiate National Championships. He also anchored the Cal Poly mixed team relay, named Creamy Cone Kitty after his shirt, to another 3rd place finish.
                Devin first started competing in middle distance triathlon at the end of 2017 and found success at that distance quickly. He has competed in all the 2017-2021 Ironman 70.3 World Championships and brought home the World Age Group Title in 2021, which
                was the first time an American has won since he started the sport back in 2013. Switching his focus to the full Ironman distance in 2022, Devin completed his first race at this new distance and came 3rd for his age division in the postponed 2021 Ironman
                World Championships. Knowing there were improvements to be made, he focused his sights on the 2022 Ironman World Championship in Kona, Hawaii, the very same event that he saw online so many years ago. Crossing the finish line as the second overall amatuer
                was a full circle moment for Devin, but he is best known from this event as the viral competitor who went back to help a female athlete cross the finish line. In 2023, Devin is focusing on racing as a professional, growing his coaching business, and developing
                as a computer programmer.

                <h1>Interests</h1>
                <p>When Devin is not training, he likes to spend time outside doing the other non-triathlon activities he enjoys and spending time with his partner, Lacy. In the winters, 
                you can find them cruising around the slopes of Mt. Bachelor or strolling around Bend's river front. Summer time means a change in temperature. During these warmer days, 
                they has been scene floating the river and listening to listening to some live music from their paddle board. When there is extra free time, Devin enjoys playing music or just
                hanging out and watching a show or movie.
